## My Greatest Fear?
I have a massive fear of dying alone, which I believe stems from another fear of mine- the fear of the unknown. However, I wouldn't consider that fear of the unknown as
my greatest fear, since most things that I don't know- someone else does. Death however, is unknown to everyone; we all have different **beliefs**, but there's no **truth**.
That's why I'd at least want to be surrunded by people who care for me once I make that leap to the "other side".
